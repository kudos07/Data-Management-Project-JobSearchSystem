- **Employee Login:** Job seekers can edit job postings, and check for candidates of company.

- **Candidate Login:** Candidates have the ability to browse job listings, and apply for jobs.

## Database

We have populated the SQL database with 100 rows of sample data to provide a realistic environment for testing and development.

## Technologies Used
